        Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young Italian
        star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. It was among Shakespeare's most
        popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Today,
        the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.
